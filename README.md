# Computer-Architecture-MIPS

### Task Description:
In this task, the goal is to implement a program that manages requests based on their priorities in a system. The system comprises four lists, each with a capacity of 20 elements. Requests are associated with one of four priorities (1-Critical, 2-High, 3-Medium, 4-Low). Upon arrival, a request is stored in the list with available space, starting from the first list.

### Program Features:
The program provides users with the following functionalities:

- **Search Request:** Utilize Binary Search on the lists to search for a specific request based on criteria such as request data, priority, or both.

- **Delete Requests by Priority:** Remove all requests with a specified priority.

- **Process Requests by Priority:** Process (print) all requests with a specific priority.

- **Empty All Lists:** Clear all lists, removing all stored requests.

 **Bonus:** Sort all requests through one list or all lists (Quick Sort).
 Hints: request can be any character a, b ,c ..etc, process request is printing it.


### Execution Instructions
To run the MIPS code, follow the steps outlined below:

- **Java Runtime Environment (JRE):** Ensure that the 'Java Runtime Environment' is installed on your system.

- **Mars MIPS Simulator:** Download the 'Mars MIPS simulator' from the official website.

- **Launch Mars MIPS Simulator:** Open the 'Mars.jar' file to start the Mars MIPS simulator.

- **Select Assembly File:** Load the MIPS assembly code file (with the '.asm' extension) within the Mars MIPS simulator.

- **Compile the Code:** Choose 'Run' => 'Assemble' to compile the MIPS assembly code.

- **Execute the Code:** Initiate the program execution by pressing the 'Run' button within the Mars MIPS simulator.
