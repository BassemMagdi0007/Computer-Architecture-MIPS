### Task Description:
In this task, the goal is to implement a program that manages requests based on their priorities in a system. The system comprises four lists, each with a capacity of 20 elements. Requests are associated with one of four priorities (1-Critical, 2-High, 3-Medium, 4-Low). Upon arrival, a request is stored in the list with available space, starting from the first list.

### Program Features:

- **Search Request:** Utilize Binary Search on the lists to search for a specific request based on criteria such as request data, priority, or both.

- **Delete Requests by Priority:** Remove all requests with a specified priority.

- **Process Requests by Priority:** Process (print) all requests with a specific priority.

- **Empty All Lists:** Clear all lists, removing all stored requests.

 **Bonus:** Sort all requests through one list or all lists (Quick Sort).
